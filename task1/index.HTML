    <h3>Challenge 1</h3>
    <p>
      Given a chemical formula (given as a string), return the count of each
      atom. The atomic element always starts with an uppercase letter, then zero
      or more lowercase letters, representing the name. One or more digits
      representing that elementâ€™s count may follow if the count is greater than
      1. If the count is 1, no digits will follow. For example, H2O and H2O2 are
      possible, but H1O2 is impossible. Two formulas concatenated together to
      produce another formula. For example, H2O2He3Mg4 is also a formula. A
      formula placed in parentheses, and a count (optionally added) is also a
      formula. For example, (H2O2) and (H2O2)3 are formulas. Given a formula,
      return the count of all elements as a string in the following form: the
      first name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more
      than 1), followed by the second name (in sorted order), followed by its
      count (if that count is more than 1), and so on.
